## Overview

**SightX** is an advanced AI‑powered surveillance system engineered to detect violent activity in real-time. 

By integrating a state-of-the-art deep learning model—**YOLO**—with a streamlined, minimal desktop application, SightX delivers a proactive approach to security. The platform prioritizes backend intelligence, ensuring robust threat detection while providing critical alerts, incident logging, and system monitoring through an unobtrusive frontend interface.

        C --> D[YOLO<br/>Object & Violence Detection]
    end
    
    D --> G{Violence Detected?}

## Key Features

- **Real‑Time Video Feed:** Live monitoring with dynamic bounding box detection overlays.
- **Violence Classification:** Highly accurate threat detection with live confidence scores.
- **System Stat Monitoring:** Keep track of hardware performance (RAM, CPU, GPU, FPS).
- **Automated Incident Logging:** Securely stores timestamped threat events into a local SQLite database.
- **Instant Threat Alerts:** Triggers visual red banners and automated voice alerts upon threat detection.
- **Demo Mode:** Built-in controlled environment for easy demonstrations and testing.

## Real-World Impact

SightX is designed to save lives and reduce response times across various critical sectors:

- **Bank Security:** Proactively detects gunpoint robberies. Integrates with existing CCTV systems to automatically alert law enforcement without requiring human intervention.
- **School Safety:** Monitors campuses for weapons or violent altercations, ensuring immediate alerts to authorities to help prevent tragedies.
- **Public Spaces:** Enhances public safety in crowded areas like malls and transit stations through automated, real-time threat reporting.
